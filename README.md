# 📊 Bank Marketing and Telecommunication - EDA

### 🔍 Project Type: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

---

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a dataset from a **bank marketing campaign** that used **telecommunication methods (calls, SMS)** to promote term deposits. The goal is to uncover key trends, insights, and customer behavior patterns that can help improve future marketing strategies and client targeting.

---

## 📁 Dataset Information

* **Source:** UCI Bank Marketing Dataset / Kaggle
* **Rows:** \~45,000 customer records
* **Columns:** 16 attributes (e.g., age, job, marital status, contact type, previous outcomes)
* **Target Variable:** `y` (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit – yes/no)

---

## 🧪 Key Questions Explored

* What customer attributes affect the likelihood of subscription?
* Does the type or duration of communication impact customer response?
* How do demographics like age, job, and education influence marketing success?
* Are there patterns based on previous campaign outcomes?

---

## 🔧 EDA Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values
   * Converted categorical data into readable format
   * Checked data types and inconsistencies

2. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Distribution plots of age, balance, contact duration
   * Bar charts for categorical features (job, marital, education)

3. **Bivariate Analysis**

   * Cross-tabulation and plots between features and target
   * Heatmap for correlation analysis

4. **Outlier Detection**

   * Identified and visualized outliers using boxplots and IQR method

5. **Insights & Observations**

   * Derived meaningful marketing insights
   * Highlighted key features influencing customer conversion

---

## 📌 Key Insights

* **Contact Duration** is the strongest indicator of success — longer calls → higher conversions.
* **Previous outcomes** (`poutcome`) from past campaigns significantly influence current decisions.
* **Age Group 30–50** showed the highest positive response.
* **"Cellular" contact method** was more effective than "telephone".
* **Married and unemployed individuals** were less likely to subscribe.

---

## 📉 Visualizations

* Pie charts showing target imbalance
* Boxplots for age, balance, duration
* Bar graphs comparing categorical variables vs subscription rate
* Correlation heatmaps
